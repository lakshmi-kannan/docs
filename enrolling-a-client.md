ScaleFT credentials are granular to the combination of a User and the User's device.
Users must enroll their devices with the ScaleFT Client, similarly to how servers
enroll in Projects. Verifying the details of the devices that Users use to access
your infrastructure allows ScaleFT to make better-informed decisions about the risk
of issuing credentials.



## Enrolling Your Device

Once the ScaleFT Client is installed, the User should enroll the device. To
do so, run `sft enroll` in your terminal. Based on the team's authentication
configurations, this should open a web browser, or open the ScaleFT Dashboard
so the User can complete the client enrollment process.
