A team is a group of people who work together on infrastructure and share an authentication method (such as OAuth).

When you create a team, by default you are given "Team Administrator" permissions. By default, any additional team members will belong only to the `everyone` group, which grants certain view-only permissions. Additional permissions, such as SSH access, must be granted by you or another team administrator.

### Choose a Team Name

Your team name must be unique to you (and cannot contain spaces). All resources you create and manage with ScaleFT will be scoped to your team.
