A Team is a group of people who work together on infrastructure and share an authentication method (such as OAuth).

When you create a Team, by default you are given Team Administrator permissions. By default, any additional Team members will belong only to the `everyone` Group, which grants certain view-only permissions. Additional permissions, such as SSH access, must be granted by you or another Team Administrator.

### Choose a Team name

Your Team name must be unique to you (and cannot contain spaces). All resources you create and manage with ScaleFT will be scoped to your Team.
